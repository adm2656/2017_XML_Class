I use most of my method	from Project1 to modify the xml file

How to run it?
run EchoServer first and run EchoClient
and the thing you have to do is following the instruction in my application 

you don’t need to give Server and Client a port since I have already done it , the port is 8888 and the ip is 127.0.0.1(localhost)

This application isn’t totally complete since the deadline pressure. if I have time I will complete it
